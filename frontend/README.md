# frontend
From Chen: I'm using this project: https://github.com/gothinkster/vue-realworld-example-app to guide my project structure.
store.js will be used to remember the user if they log in
components will have reusable Vue components like the header
views will have content that is specific to a page
service.js will be responsible for making the API calls
router/index.js will be where the routing is defined

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
