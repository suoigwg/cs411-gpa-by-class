# frontend
From Chen: I'm using this project: https://github.com/gothinkster/vue-realworld-example-app to guide my project structure.
store.js will be used to remember the user if they log in
components will have reusable Vue components like the header
views will have content that is specific to a page
api.service.js will be responsible for making the API calls
router/index.js will be where the routing is defined

Delete HelloWorld.vue when you get around to making the actual GPA page

> A Vue.js project
